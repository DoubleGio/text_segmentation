#  Related work


This sheet contains tips on your related work section. 

## The role of the related work section. Why?

* Your work is **grounded** in earlier work done by others. That means you use 
    * techniques, and methods;
    * ways of measuring and evaluating;
    * datasets;
    * the terminology;
* used by others before you working on the same or a related problem.
* You want to **compare** your results with those of others, in particular with the *State Of The Art (SOTA)*.
* These two points  are the main  role of the related work section. 
* Besides, you 
    * *inform* the reader on the SOTA, and the state of the problem and the solutions
    * *show* that you know what you are talking about; that you know what is "for sale"; and that you use the best there is.

## Related work vs Background

* Sometimes you want to *explain* techniques that you use, referring to the literature. This can go to a *background* section. 
* In the related work you describe how other people have dealt with similar problems as you are dealing with. What were their techniqies, what were their results, what observations did they make that you have used, etc.


## Form

1. Organize your related work section into 3-4 subsections.
2. Indicate which subsection belongs to which (group of) RQ's. (just for yourself , you ca remove that later)
3. You have a starting subsection which simply lists and describes the _state of the art_ regarding your main research question. Roughly 5-10 references, each described in 2-3 sentences.
4.  The other subsections are usually more technical and you use them to describe and refer to technologies and methodologies that you will use for answering your RQs.  
 
### Tips on related literature
* Use this schema for your citation keys: `nnnn:aaaayy`, where nnnn are the first 4 characters of the first author, aaaa the first four characters of the first non stopword of the title and yy the last two digits of the publication year.
* Save all pdfs in a literature folder and use the same name for the file as that bibtex key. 
* Use markers and notes to annotate the pdfs so you can quickly find the important parts back.
* Write for each article a small synopsis with the 3-4 main points, a short abstract in your own words and 2-3 lines why this is relevant to your research. 

## Peer review criteria and guidelines

1. Read the main RQ and the subRQs again, and make sure you "get them".
2. Think for a while how *you* would answer these RQs. How you would start research on those questions. What difficulties you can foresee (not for yourself, but for anyone trying to answer these RQs)
3. Then start reading the *related work* section, while keeping the above guidelines in mind.

### Questions

1. Do you know have an overview of the approaches to the problem, and the "state" of the solution?
2. Do you have a somewhat clear view of the SOTA?
3. Could you relate all things you've read to specific RQs?
4. Are you *convinced* that the author knows the field, that she uses cutting edge technology/solutions, that indeed she places herself in a tradition to which she adds a little?
5. Can **you** give a brief expos&eacute; on the RQs and the state of science regarding this topic based on what you have read in the related work?
